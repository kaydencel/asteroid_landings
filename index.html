    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <h3>Background</h3>
    <p>
      Before the establishment of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), meteor landings were primarily observed using a 
      combination of the naked eye, telescopes, and other simple techniques that did not require advanced technology. With NASA's formation in 1958, 
      this changed significantly, as meteor landings began to be monitored through various technologies, including radar, satellites, and artificial intelligence.
       Technological advancements have enabled NASA to gather more accurate data points and information about meteor landings. In this project, our group aims to 
       understand how known meteor landings differ before and after NASA's establishment. We seek to discover if and how advanced technologies have altered the 
       observation and discovery of known meteor landings.

       <br>

       This research not only highlights the evolution of technology in space science but also helps assess how advancements
        in data collection and observation have influenced the perceived frequency, distribution, and detection accuracy of meteor landings.
    </p>

    <h3>What are Meteors?</h3>
    <p>
      Meteors (commonly referred to as “shooting stars”) are caused 
      by space debris entering Earth’s atmosphere. These objects, usually fragments of comets or asteroids,
       burn up due to intense friction with the air. If a meteor survives its descent and lands on Earth, it is then classified as a meteorite. 
       Studying these objects offers valuable insight into the early solar system and can help scientists assess potential future threats from space.

    </p>

    <h3>NASA's Milestones with Meteors</h3>
    <p>
        <b>1970s-1980s:</b> NASA began funding Antarctic expeditions<br>
        <b>1990s:</b> NASA established programs to detect potentially hazardous asteroids<br>
        <b>2010s:</b> The OSIRIS-REx mission launched<br>
        <b>2022:</b> NASA made history with the DART mission
    </p>

    <h3>Why Meteors Matter</h3>
    <p>
      Studying meteors is crucial for scientists because it enhances our understanding of the history and composition of our solar system.
       Meteors are fragments of asteroids or comets that enter Earth’s atmosphere. By analyzing these meteors, researchers can 
       gain insights into the early conditions that shaped planets and other celestial bodies. Some meteorites contain materials that are
        billions of years old, providing valuable clues about the formation of the solar system. Additionally, studying meteors helps us
         understand potential threats from space, enabling us to develop strategies for detecting and possibly deflecting hazardous objects before 
         they reach Earth. This research not only deepens our knowledge of the universe but also contributes to efforts in planetary defense.
    </p>

    <h3>The Future of Meteors</h3>
    <p>
      NASA continues to monitor the skies, track space rocks, and plan missions to asteroids that could hold important
       scientific clues—or even pose potential threats to Earth. With advancements in telescope technology, AI-driven detection systems, 
       and international collaborations, the future of meteor science looks promising. Upcoming missions aim to bring back more asteroid samples,
        test planetary defense strategies, and deepen our understanding of how these objects have shaped—and continue to influence—our planet. 
        As we collect more data and develop better tools, we’ll be able to predict, track, and study meteorites with more accuracy than ever before.
    </p>

    <h2>Data</h2>
    <p>
      We used a dataset provided by The Meteoritical Society and NASA, which includes 45,717 documented meteorite landings.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Categorical features:</strong> name, nametype, recclass, fall</li>
      <li><strong>Continuous features:</strong> id, mass (g), year, reclat, reclong, GeoLocation</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This dataset is ideal for our research goal because it allows us to conduct a comparative analysis of meteors discovered both before and after NASA's formation. 
      Research from Russia (Dudrov 2020, 233) indicates that meteors tend to fall within specific time frames, suggesting that they follow certain patterns. 
      This means that after a certain number of years, there tends to be a significant influx of meteors.

      In this analysis, we intend to investigate this phenomenon more deeply and determine how meteor landings have changed from before to after NASA's discovery. 
      We will also examine whether there was a disproportionate number of meteors found during specific years in contrast to others as well as if they tended
      to fall in specific areas during these times. 

      <h3>Preprocessing</h3>
      <p>
        We cleaned this data set to only include meteorite landings from 1940-1980 so we could analyze the data before and after NASA was founded.
        We also created a new column to map the meteorites classsifications (recclass) to their respective type. 
        We referenced the American Museum of Natural History's meteorite classification for this information.
